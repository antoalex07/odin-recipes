		<h1> Frozen Watermelon Rosemary Margaritas </h1>
		<img src = "images/margaritas.jpg" alt = "image">
		<h2> <strong> Description </strong></h2>
		<p>This is a cocktail riff on a lemonade recipe we love (armagazine.com/rosemary-infused-watermelon-lemonade). The herb-melon combo is delicious, and watermelon's natural sweetness keeps added sugar low.<br></p>
		<h3> Ingredients </h3>
		<ul>
			<li> water

			<li> white sugar </li>

			<li> chopped fresh rosemary </li>

			<li> cubed seeded watermelon </li>

			<li> lemon juice </li>

			<li> kosher salt </li>

			<li> white sugar </li>

			<li> reposado tequila </li>

			<li> rosemary sprigs for serving </li>

			<li> watermelon wedges for serving </li>
			
		</ul>
		
		<h3> Steps </h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Bring 1 cup water and 1/3 cup sugar to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring occasionally to dissolve sugar. Stir in chopped rosemary. Let steep for1 hour.</li>

			<li>Strain rosemary syrup into a blender. Add watermelon and lemon juice. Pur√©e until smooth, about 30 seconds. Strain lemonade mixture, then freeze in ice cube trays until solid, 8 hours or overnight.</li>


			<li>Mix together salt and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar in a small shallow dish. Lightly dampen rims of 4 (12-ounce) glasses with a wet paper towel. Roll glass rims in salt-sugar mixture until coated.</li>


			<li>Working in batches, blend half of the frozen watermelon-lemonade cubes and 4 ounces tequila in a blender or food processor until slushy, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons of water as needed to help blend mixture. Pour into prepared glasses. Repeat with remaining watermelon-lemonade cubes and remaining tequila. Garnish with rosemary sprigs and watermelon wedges.</li>
